# My Python Project
Here's my collection of small Python projects and practice exercises covering fundamentals of programming, data processing, simple games, and basic automation scripts. This repository is mainly built for learning, experimentation, and showcasing hands-on Python skills through multiple mini-projects.
# Contents
Inside the MyPythonProject folder, you’ll find several independent exercises/projects, including:
- Data_Sorting_of_Baby_Names
Practice with data handling, sorting, and basic analysis using structured datasets.
- TheBreakoutGame
A simple game implementation to explore event handling, game loops, and object-based design.
- Valid Email Address
Input validation and string-processing practice, likely involving rule checks and pattern matching.
- stanCodoshop

In addition, there are standalone scripts:
- bouncing_ball.py
A small simulation/animation-style exercise.
- draw_line.py
A basic graphics/interaction script for practicing coordinate-based drawing.
- webcrawler.py
An introductory web crawling/scripted data retrieval practice.


# Goals
This repository demonstrates:
- Core Python syntax and programming logic
- Working with data structures and simple datasets
- Building small interactive or visual programs
- Implementing beginner-friendly game mechanics
- Introduction to scripting and web-related tasks


# How to Run
- Most projects can be run directly with Python: python <script_name>.py
- For folder-based projects:
cd MyPythonProject/<project_folder>
python main.py
