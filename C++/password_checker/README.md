## Password Checker
### Password Rules
A password is considered **strong** if it:
1. Has **at least 8 characters**
2. Contains **at least one uppercase letter** (`A–Z`)
3. Contains **at least one digit** (`0–9`)

If the password is not strong, the program will print which conditions are missing.
